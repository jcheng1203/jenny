I first heard about this book because I listened to an interview of the author, David Epstein. Its basic premise is that there are two different ways of approaching expertise: the "Tiger" method and the "Roger" method. The "Tiger" method refers to Tiger Woods, whose dad got him to focus exclusively on golf from the time he was 7 months old. The "Roger" method refers to Roger Federer, who dabbled in multiple sports and didn't settle on tennis until the age of 12. 

Epstein then argues that the "Tiger" method works only in certain situations, which he calls "kind" learning environments. These are environments in which goals are simple, and you can achieve those goals by mastering patterns. However, the real world often is not "kind". It's what Epstein calls "wicked". Goals and conditions are in flux, and solutions are not algorithmic. To succeed in such an environment, you need range.

### Fun Tidbits

* The story about the _figlie del coro_ who mastered multiple instruments and were Venetian rockstars.
* Too much grit can be a bad thing, if you don't know when to quit.

### Caveat

Although I found the book gratifying and invigorating (really! I was surprised it energized me so much!), one thing that gives me pause is the possibility of confirmation bias. I enjoyed the book because I myself am a dabbler who has an array of interests, and based on skimming some positive reviews of the book, it seems that many other people who enjoyed the book are dabblers too. So maybe we just all want to believe that are dabbling ways are a key to success?

### Takeaways

If Epstein is right, then this book can serve as a guiding light as we enter an uncertain future where more and more jobs are automated. Robots are good at tactics, but we'll need more people with range to be the strategists.
