I've been in a "books about dying people" phase. Prior to _The Unwinding of a Miracle_ by Julie Yip-Williams, I've read:

* _When Breath Becomes Air_ by Paul Kalanithi
* _Everything Happens for a Reason, and Other Lies I've Loved_ by Kate Bowler

I think these books help me confront death and mortality by proxy.
