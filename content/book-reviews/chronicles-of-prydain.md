I have a soft spot for children's fantasy as a genre, because my favorite books growing up were _The Silmarillion_, the _Redwall_ series, and, of course, _Harry Potter_. So a few weeks ago when I was looking for fun books to read, the name Lloyd Alexander came to mind. I had seen his books as a child and somehow had favorable impressions of them, but I can't remember if I ever read them. So I checked them out from the library and quickly read books 1, 2, 3, and 5. I skipped _Taran Wanderer_ because I wanted to skip ahead to the ending, but by the time I finished _The High King_, I was invested enough in the main character to want to read more about his journey.

When you first meet Taran, the main character, he's newly given the title of Assistant Pig-Keeper. At first it's given to him kinda tongue-in-cheek by his guardians Coll and Dalben, who are humoring his desire to have a title in life. Like many young men, Taran has delusions of his own grandeur and dreams of making his mark on the world. Over the course of the series, young Taran grows out of these delusions and matures into someone who actually does make a mark on the world.

I'm not a teenager anymore, and I've never been a man, but Taran's journey is very relatable. I remember when I graduated from college and felt like I could take on the world and be someone great. I can't say I've fully matured past these childish ambitions, but I'm beginning to see my own limitations and how I fall short of who I want to be.

_The Black Cauldron_ is perhaps the most representative mini-journey within Taran's overall arc. There's a character named Ellidyr, who embodies the darkest aspect of Taran's ambition from _The Book of Three_.
